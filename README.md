# Castled_Realms

This project is built using Pygame, sprinkled with some AI magic to create a smart opponent thats ready to crush you on the board 😎😎.

## Extra features:

-   Supports advanced mechanics like en passant, castling, and pawn promotion (currently auto-promotes to Queen — I mean, who doesn't go for a Queen, right? Unless you're into that sneaky Knight play 😏).

-   The engine uses the classic NegaMax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning to prune away bad moves and search for the best ones. Yes, it gets a bit slow at times (but hey I'm talking about searching through more than 9000+ possible moves 😅).

-   Working on some advanced search techniques to make the AI faster in response.{So stay tuned...🫡🫡}

-   Currently exploring how to integrate Neural Networks into the decision-making process for even smarter gameplay.🫡
