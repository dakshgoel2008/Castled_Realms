# Castled_Realms

This project is made out of Pygame using some AI techniques to make a smart opponent for you who can defeat youðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž.

## Extra features:

I have integrated modern chess moves like em-passant, Castling, pawn promotion(Currently it is only promoted to Queen {Honestly I always prefer Queen while playing except a knight of course}).

-   Working on Neta Max and alpha beta pruning searching algorithms to find a good move.

-   Currently exploring the possibilies to integrate NN into itðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž.
